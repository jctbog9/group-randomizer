# group-randomizer

This terminal-friendly application will take in the names of all of the team members involved in a project and randomize the groups they will end up in.

The names of group members are housed in a variable on line 1 of the code marked `members`. To change the names within the group, edit the `members` array.

To run the application navigate to the root directory of the project and run `ruby random-groups.rb`
